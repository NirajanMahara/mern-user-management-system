## Introduction
The User Management System is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to manage user data efficiently. It features robust authentication, CRUD operations, and advanced data visualization, all wrapped in a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure login and registration processes using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Encryption**: Utilizes bcrypt for hashing passwords to ensure data security.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions effectively to maintain security and user experience.

### 2. User Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Full suite of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for user data.
- **Batch Operations**: Allows for efficient management of multiple user records simultaneously.
- **Data Export**: Users can export data to Excel or CSV formats for external use.

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Interactive Charts**: Provides visual insights into user data through dynamic charts.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Visualizes user distribution across different regions.
- **Age Demographics**: Displays age-related data trends.
- **User Trends**: Tracks and visualizes user growth over time.

### 4. UI/UX Features
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Offers a toggle between dark and light modes for better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is accessible on various devices.
- **Interactive Data Grid**: Utilizes AG-Grid for efficient data handling and display.
- **Real-time Search/Filter**: Provides instant feedback as users search or filter data.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: Provides a set of React components for faster and easier web development.
- **AG-Grid**: Used for creating a powerful and flexible data grid.
- **Recharts**: Library for building responsive charts.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to build APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to manage data relationships.

### Authentication & Security
- **JWT**: For secure token-based authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing passwords.

### Additional Tools
- **Formik & Yup**: For form management and validation.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the client-side.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Theme Implementation
- **Challenge**: Implementing a seamless dark/light theme toggle.
- **Solution**: Utilized React Context API to manage theme state globally, ensuring consistent theme application across components.

### 2. Data Grid Performance
- **Challenge**: Handling large datasets efficiently in the data grid.
- **Solution**: Implemented AG-Grid's virtualization feature to improve performance by only rendering visible rows.

### 3. Chart Responsiveness
- **Challenge**: Ensuring charts are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Solution**: Used Recharts' responsive container components to automatically adjust chart dimensions.
